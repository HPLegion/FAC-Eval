# Questions concerning DR Studies with FAC

- What is the best / most efficient way to set up the electron configurations to limit their number
  and the number of transitions?
- Higher order recombinations (QR and above) seem to have very small contributions to the total
  recombination rate for KLL, KLM, LMM - Is this generally a good assumption? Can we ignore them?
  And how?
- Is there another way to estimate the radiative decay strength than to compute all channels by 
  brute force?
- How do we deal with decay cascades? - What if a state decays into another autoionising state
  before it decays into a stable state? How likely is this?
- What data does MPIK have available and would be willing to share?
- Can the *crm* module be used to get approximated values for the total DR strength without doing
  all the detailed calculations?
- What other magic can *crm* do?
